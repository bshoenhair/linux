Broadcom iProc Clock Controller

This binding uses the common clock binding:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

The iProc clock controller manages clocks that are common to iProc chips.
The controllers are split into a parent-child relationship where the parent is
the PLL and the child controls the PLL's channels.

The only PLL controlled is the ARM PLL which is derived from a 25MHz crystal.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be one of the following:
    "brcm,iproc-arm-a9pll" - Controls ARM PLL.
    "brcm,iproc-arm-ch" -  Controls ARM PLL (parent) channels

- reg: The base address of the PLL.

- clocks: The input parent clock phandle for the clock. This is either a PLL,
  or oscillator.

- channel: The PLL channel that the clock belongs to. This is used for
  "brcm,iproc-arm-ch" only.

- #clock-cells: From common clock binding; shall be set to 0.

Example:

	osc: oscillator {
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "fixed-clock";
		clock-frequency = <25000000>;
	};

	a9pll: arm_clk@19000000 {
		compatible = "brcm,iproc-arm-a9pll";
		reg = <0x19000000 0x1000>;
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clocks = <&osc>;
	};

	periph_clk: periph_clk@19000000 {
		compatible = "brcm,iproc-arm-ch";
		reg = <0x19000000 0x1000>;
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clocks = <&a9pll>;
		channel = <3>;
	};
