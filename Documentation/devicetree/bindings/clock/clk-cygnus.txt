Broadcom Cygnus Clock Controller

This binding uses the common clock binding:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

The Cygnus clock controller manages several PLL's and their channels, found only
on the Cygnus chip. Clocks that are common to iProc can be found in the iProc
clock controller. The controllers are split into a parent-child relationship
where the parent is the PLL and the child controls the PLL's channels.

All PLL's are derived from a 25MHz oscillator. The PLL's controlled are the
GENPLL, LCPLL, the MIPI PLL. In addition, there are two clocks derived from
GENPLL channel 0, and three that are derived directly from the oscillator.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be one of the following:
    "brcm,cygnus-lcpll-clk" - Controls LCPLL.
    "brcm,cygnus-lcpll-ch" -  Controls LCPLL (parent) channels
    "brcm,cygnus-genpll-clk" - Controls parent GENPLL
    "brcm,cygnus-genpll-ch" - Controls GENPLL (parent) channels
    "brcm,cygnus-mipipll-clk" - Controls MIPI PLL
    "brcm,cygnus-mipipll-ch" - Controls parent MIPI PLL (parent) channels
    "brcm,cygnus-osc-derived" - Controls oscillator (parent) derived channels
        not controlled by any PLL.
    "brcm,cygnus-pll-derived" - Controls clocks derived from GENPLL channel 0.
	  These clocks have hard wired internal dividers and their clock rates
	  scale according to the GENPLL channel.

- reg: First register is the base address of the PLL. Register 2 and 3 are
  required by some clocks. They are the top clock gating control used to
  enable/disable clocks (ch 1), and the CRMU PLL AON CONTROL register which
  powers on PLL/LDO's (ch 2).

- clocks: The input parent clock phandle for the clock. This is either a PLL,
  oscillator, or GENPLL channel 0.

- channel: The PLL channel that the clock belongs to. This is used for
  "brcm,cygnus-lcpll-ch", "brcm,cygnus-genpll-ch", "brcm,cygnus-mipipll-ch",
  "brcm,cygnus-osc-derived" only.

- div: Used by "brcm,cygnus-pll-derived" to define the hard coded internal
  divider value. Used by "brcm,cygnus-osc-derived" to specify the programmable
  divider.

- #clock-cells: From common clock binding; shall be set to 0.
